# MasterMind
Final project for grade 11 programming using Netty for networking. Works alone, but a server can be hosted using the sister project found [here](https://github.com/rsninja722/MasterMindServer)

The server was programmed together with wm-c. Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvB82nGISPg) of a game being played with our seperate clients shown side by side, my client is on the left, wm-c's is on the right
